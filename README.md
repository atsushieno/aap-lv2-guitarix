# aap-lv2-guitarix: Guitarix plugin for AAP via LV2

This repository is for [Guitarix](https://github.com/brummer10/guitarix) plugin example for [AAP](https://github.com/atsushieno/android-audio-plugin-framework/). It is powered by LV2 using [aap-lv2](https://github.com/atsushieno/aap-lv2/).

Some effectors crash so far, but many effectors work.

## Building

`make` should take care of the builds. See [GitHub Actions script](.github/workflows/actions.yml) for further normative setup.

## Hacking

guitarix depends on libsndfile, and the plugin comes with many binaries. They are all built in the [atsushieno/android-native-audio-builders](https://github.com/atsushieno/android-native-audio-builders/) repo.

With all those prebuilt binaries, we don't really build native binary in this repo.

Our `aap_metadata.xml` is generated by `aap-import-lv2-metadata` tool at build time, which is part of submodule `aap-lv2`. `Makefile` specifies the submodule path to it.


## Licensing notice

aap-lv2-guitarix codebase is distributed under the MIT license.

LV2 (repository for the headers) is under the ISC license.

`guitarix` is distributed under the GPL v3 license. Hence this is applied to the entire application.

The entire plugin application bundles `androidaudioplugin-lv2` AAR module from `aap-lv2`, and `androidaudioplugin` AAR module, and is packaged into one application.
